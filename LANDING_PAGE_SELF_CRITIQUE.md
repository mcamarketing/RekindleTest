---

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING - Stripe/Linear Level

### 1. Pricing Transparency ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status: EXCELLENT**
- ✅ Simple, clear ACV-based tiers (£29, £199, £799)
- ✅ No confusing formulas or hidden math
- ✅ Per-meeting fees clearly stated (£100, £250, £500-£1000)

- ✅ 99.9% uptime SLA commitment

### 3. Copy Tone ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status: EXCELLENT**
- ✅ "Recover dormant pipeline" (calm, not "Start recovering today!")
- ✅ "Request access" (confident, not "Apply now!")
- ✅ "Simple, transparent pricing" (direct, not "revolutionary")
- ✅ Zero exclamation marks in CTAs
- ✅ Matches Linear's calm, confident voice

### 4. Design System ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status: EXCELLENT**
- ✅ Clean color palette (#0a2540, #425466, #e3e8ee)
- ✅ Consistent card-based layouts
- ✅ Proper use of whitespace
- ✅ Framer Motion animations (subtle, not distracting)

- ✅ 4-step process clearly visualized
- ✅ "No data retention" explicitly stated

## 🔄 AREAS FOR POTENTIAL REFINEMENT

### 1. Hero Section - Minor Polish Opportunities
**Current:** Very good, but could be even more minimal
- Hero has animated gradient orbs (Stripe doesn't use these)
- Could simplify to pure white/gradient background
- Consider removing some visual effects for more minimalism
**Verdict:** Optional - current state is still high quality

### 2. Founding Pilot Badge - Slightly Too Prominent?
**Current:** Has animated pulse dot, gradient text
- Stripe/Linear use more subtle badges
- Could reduce visual weight slightly
**Verdict:** Minor - doesn't detract from trust

### 3. ROI Calculator Section - Information Density
**Current:** Shows 3 detailed examples with breakdown
- Good transparency, but lot of numbers
- Stripe tends to simplify to 1-2 examples max
**Verdict:** Debatable - transparency vs. simplicity tradeoff

### 4. Multi-Channel Section - Data Viz Complexity
**Current:** 4 channels with 3 metrics each = 12 data points
- Very informative, but borders on overwhelming
- Linear would show less data, more whitespace
**Verdict:** Consider consolidating or highlighting top 2 channels

## ❌ POTENTIAL ISSUES (NONE CRITICAL)

### No Critical Issues Found
All major enterprise requirements have been met:
- ✅ Zero fabricated content
- ✅ Transparent pricing (no hidden formulas)
- ✅ Calm, confident tone throughout
- ✅ Real data with proper sourcing
- ✅ Trust signals front and center
- ✅ Proper channel references (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, Voicemail)
