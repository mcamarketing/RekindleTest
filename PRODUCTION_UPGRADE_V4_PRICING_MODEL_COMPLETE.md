## 📊 **VI. BUSINESS IMPACT**

### **Strategic Positioning**

**BEFORE (V2/V3):**
- "Pay only for results" (unrealistic expectation)
- No mention of infrastructure costs
- Risk: Buyers expect $0 base fee

**AFTER (V4):**
- Clear two-part model (sets realistic expectations)
- Justifies platform fee (infrastructure, security, support)
- Emphasizes that 80%+ of spend is still performance-based
- Refund policy on performance fee reduces risk perception

### **Customer Journey Improvements**

1. **Landing Page:** Immediately understands pricing structure
2. **Pricing Page:** Sees exact breakdown with pilot program badge
3. **Risk Reversal Section:** Feels protected by refund policy
4. **Billing Dashboard:** Real-time transparency builds trust
5. **Terms of Service:** Legal clarity prevents disputes

### **Objection Handling**

**Objection:** "Why is there a platform fee?"
**Answer:** "It covers real costs: 99.9% uptime, SOC 2 security, dedicated support. The vast majority (80%+) of your spend is still performance-based."

**Objection:** "What if meetings no-show?"
**Answer:** "Performance fee is 100% refundable. You only pay for meetings that happen."

**Objection:** "How much will this really cost?"
**Answer:** "Platform fee (£99) + 2.5% ACV per booked meeting. If you book 10 meetings at £2,500 ACV, total = £99 + £625 = £724. Most of that (£625) is performance-based."
