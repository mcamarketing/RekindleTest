# 🎯 LANDING PAGE FUNNEL AUDIT & RESTRUCTURE

**Date:** November 7, 2025  
**Issue:** Landing page sections don't flow as a cohesive sales funnel  
**Goal:** Progressive conviction-building from scroll 1 to final CTA

---

## ❌ **CURRENT FUNNEL STRUCTURE (BROKEN FLOW)**

### Current Section Order:
1. **HERO** - "Revive Your Cold Leads. Pay Mostly for Results. Performance-First Pricing."
2. **PROBLEM** - "The Hidden £100K+ Problem Rotting in Your CRM"
3. **SOLUTION** - "AI Does the Heavy Lifting"
4. **CHANNELS** - "One Lead, Five Channels"
5. **PRICING** - "Two-Part Pricing: Platform + Performance" ⚠️ (TOO EARLY!)
6. **FEATURE** - "The Engine That Finds [Perfect Timing]"
7. **CONTROL** - "You're Always [In Control]"
8. **COMPARISON** - "Three Costly Options. One Smart Choice" ⚠️ (REDUNDANT - Problem already established)
9. **SOCIAL PROOF** - "Real Results from Pilot Program"
10. **FINAL CTA** - "Stop Letting £100K+ Die in Your CRM"

### **CRITICAL ISSUES:**

1. **PRICING TOO EARLY (Section 5):**
   - We're asking for the sale before fully demonstrating value
   - Pricing should come AFTER proof, benefits, and social validation
   - Current position kills momentum before features/proof land

2. **NO CLEAR "HOW IT WORKS" FLOW:**
   - Sections 3, 4, 6, 7 are features/benefits but feel disconnected
   - Need a clear 3-4 step "Here's exactly how this works" section

3. **"THREE COSTLY OPTIONS" REDUNDANT:**
   - Problem already established in Section 2
   - This comparison should be EARLIER (before solution) or removed

4. **MISSING RISK REVERSAL:**
   - No dedicated "100% Money-Back Guarantee" section
   - Risk reversal is buried in pricing copy

5. **NO URGENCY/SCARCITY:**
   - "Pilot Program" mentioned but not leveraged for urgency
   - No "limited spots" or deadline messaging

6. **SOCIAL PROOF TOO LATE:**
   - Section 9 (near bottom) - should be earlier to build trust

2. PROBLEM AGITATION (Make them feel the pain)
   ├─ "The Hidden £100K+ Problem Rotting in Your CRM"

   ├─ Show they're not alone (industry-wide problem)
   └─ Transition: "There's a better way..."

7. PRICING & VALUE (Remove price objections)

    └─ Trust signals reminder (SOC 2, GDPR)
```

## 🔄 **RESTRUCTURING PLAN**

### **SECTIONS TO REORDER:**

| Current Position | Section | New Position | Reason |
|-----------------|---------|--------------|---------|
| 5 | Two-Part Pricing | 7 | Pricing comes AFTER proof/value |
| 8 | Three Costly Options | 2 or REMOVE | Either agitate problem early OR remove (redundant) |
| 9 | Social Proof | 6 | Social proof before pricing |
| 3-4-6-7 | Features (scattered) | 5 | Consolidate into "Why It Works" |

### **SECTIONS TO ADD:**

1. **Dedicated "How It Works" (3-Step Visual Process)**
   - Position: Section 4 (after solution introduction)
   - Must be CLEAR, VISUAL, and SIMPLE

2. **Dedicated "Risk Reversal / Guarantee" Section**
   - Position: Section 8 (after pricing)
   - Hero-level visibility with green checkmarks and trust signals

3. **Urgency/Scarcity Section**
   - Position: Section 9 (before final CTA)
   - Leverage "Pilot Program" status for FOMO

### **SECTIONS TO REWRITE:**

1. **HERO** - Currently good, but subheadline should tease the "how" more
2. **PROBLEM** - Good, keep this early
3. **CHANNELS** - Reframe as "Why It Works" (proof), not just features
4. **PRICING** - Move later, add stronger ROI framing
5. **SOCIAL PROOF** - Move earlier, add more specific metrics
6. **FINAL CTA** - Add secondary low-commitment CTA option
