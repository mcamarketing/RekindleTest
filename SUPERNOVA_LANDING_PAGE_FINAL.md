THE PROBLEM NOBODY TALKS ABOUT
```

**Headline:**
```
Every Day You Wait, Your Competitors Are Stealing YOUR Customers.

The Same Leads You Spent £200-£5,000 Each to Acquire Are Now Booking Meetings With Your Competitors.
```

**Body:**
```
Right now, you have £500,000 to £2,000,000 worth of leads sitting dormant in your CRM.

Leads who opened your emails. Downloaded your content. Even took sales calls.

Then they went silent.

Not because your product sucks. Not because they chose a competitor.

They went silent because THE TIMING WASN'T RIGHT.

But here's the killer: While you're chasing shiny new leads at £5K/pop, your competitors are re-engaging YOUR old prospects at the EXACT moment they're ready to buy.

And you're sitting there, watching 85% of your pipeline slowly die... thinking "that's just how B2B sales works."

It doesn't have to.
```

**3 Stat Cards:**
1. **£50K** You Spent on Acquisition • Money at risk
2. **4,250** Leads Went Dormant • 85% waste rate
3. **£500K+** Lost Revenue Potential • Recoverable now

**CTA:**
