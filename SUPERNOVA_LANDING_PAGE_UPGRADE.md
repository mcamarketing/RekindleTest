THE PROBLEM NOBODY TALKS ABOUT
```

**Headline:**
```
You Spent £50K+ Acquiring Leads That Went Silent.

Your Competitors Are Re-Engaging Them Right Now.
```

**Body (3-4 short paragraphs):**
```
Right now, you have £500,000 to £2,000,000 worth of leads sitting dormant in your CRM.

Leads you PAID £200-£5,000 each to acquire through ads, events, SDRs, and outbound.

Leads who opened your emails. Downloaded your content. Even took sales calls.

Then they went silent.

Not because your product sucks. Not because they chose a competitor.

They went silent because THE TIMING WASN'T RIGHT.

But here's the killer: While you're chasing shiny new leads at £5K/pop, your competitors are re-engaging YOUR old prospects at the EXACT moment they're ready to buy.

And you're sitting there, watching 85% of your pipeline slowly die... thinking "that's just how B2B sales works."

It doesn't have to.
```

**3 Stat Cards:**
1. **£50K** You Spent on Acquisition • Money at risk
2. **4,250** Leads Went Dormant • 85% waste rate
3. **£500K+** Lost Revenue Potential • Recoverable now

**CTA (Bottom):**
```

HOW REKINDLE WORKS
```

**Headline:**
```
The "Trigger Stack" Method™

We Only Reach Out When One of 47 Buying Signals Fires.
```

**Body:**
```
While your competitors send batch-and-blast emails to everyone (and get ignored), we ONLY reach out when one of 47 buying signals fires:

✓ Job change (they just got promoted—new budget)
✓ Company funding round (they have money to spend)
✓ Hiring spike (they're scaling—need your solution NOW)
✓ Tech stack change (they just ditched your competitor)
✓ Earnings call mention (CEO literally said your keyword)

The result? 2.4x higher open rates. 5.8x higher reply rates. And meetings that actually CLOSE (because timing is everything).

This isn't email marketing. This is AI-powered market intelligence married to multi-channel outreach (Email + SMS + WhatsApp + Voicemail).
```

**4-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Upload Your Coldest Leads**
- 2 minutes. Secure sync via CRM or CSV.
- No technical setup. No API keys. Just upload and watch the AI go to work.

**Step 2: AI Pinpoints Buying Intent**
- Monitors 50+ signals per lead, 24/7.
- Funding rounds, new hires, job changes, company news, tech stack changes.
- The moment a trigger fires, we know. And we act.

**Step 3: Hyper-Personalized Multi-Channel Outreach**
- Every message is unique. No templates. No "Hi [Name]" placeholders.
- We reference the exact trigger event, the specific company news, the precise reason they should care right now.
- Email → SMS → WhatsApp → Voicemail (until they respond or opt out).

**Step 4: Revenue-Ready Meetings Booked**
- Lead replies → AI confirms → Meeting on your calendar → You close the deal.
- You only pay 2.5% of ACV when the meeting is actually booked.
- No meetings? No performance fee.

**Bottom Tagline:**
```
From dormant lead to booked meeting in 18 hours (average).

Your competitors take 2-3 weeks. You take 18 hours.
```

**CTA:**
```

Three Costly Options. Or One Smart One.

Compare the Old Ways vs. the New Approach.
```

**Comparison Table:**

| | Manual Revival | Hire SDR | Lead Agency | **Rekindle** ⭐ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Time** | 40+ hours | 3-6 month ramp | 2-3 weeks | 18 hours |
| **Monthly Cost** | £0 (your time) | £4K-6K | £2K-5K setup | £9.99-£249 |
| **Cost/Meeting** | £80-120 | N/A | £50-200 | £15-150* |
| **Meeting Rate** | 2-3% | 5-8% | 8-12% | **15.2%** |
| **Setup Time** | Immediate | 3-6 months | 2-3 weeks | 48 hours |
| **Contracts** | None | Annual | 6-12 months | Month-to-month |

*Based on 2.5% ACV per meeting

**The Math:**
```
Agencies charge £50-200 per meeting (plus £2K-5K setup).
SDRs cost £4,000-6,000/month (plus 3-6 month ramp-up).

Rekindle costs 2-3% of your deal value per meeting (typically £15-150) with a low monthly base.

50-75% cheaper. 2.3x the meeting rate. You only pay for results.
