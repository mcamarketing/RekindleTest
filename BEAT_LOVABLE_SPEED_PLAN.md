# THE SPEED TACTICS (How We Move 10x Faster)

## 1. No Demos, No Sales Cycle
**Traditional SaaS:** 30-90 day sales cycle (demo → trial → negotiation → contract)
**Rekindle:** 5-minute self-serve (signup → import leads → launch campaign)

**How:**
- Auto-generate first campaign with AI (no setup required)
- 1-click import from Salesforce/HubSpot
- Performance-based pricing (no negotiation)
- Free trial with credit card (auto-upgrade when limits hit)

**Result:** 90-day sales cycle → 1-day sales cycle (90x faster)

---

## 2. Viral Referrals Built Into Product
**Traditional SaaS:** Referral program as afterthought
**Rekindle:** Virality is core product feature

**How:**
- "Powered by Rekindle" in every email (free tier)
- Share ROI button ("We recovered $150K with Rekindle")
- Auto-invite teammates when limits hit
- Referral rewards (3 referrals → unlock Pro features)
- Public leaderboard (top customers by ROI)

**Result:** Viral coefficient 0.5 (every customer → 0.5 new customers)

**Math:**
- Month 1: 50 customers
- Month 2: 50 + (50 × 0.5) + 75 new = 150 customers
- Month 3: 150 + (150 × 0.5) + 75 new = 300 customers
- **Viral growth = 50% of new customers**

---

## 3. Daily Shipping (Not Weekly Sprints)
**Traditional SaaS:** 2-week sprints, monthly releases
**Rekindle:** Ship 1 feature per day, 365 features per year

**How:**
- Feature flags (ship to 10% → 50% → 100%)
- No QA (users are QA, fix bugs in hours not days)
- Continuous deployment (every commit = production)
- Customer feedback loop (talk to 10 customers daily)

**Result:** Ship 10x faster than competitors

---

## 4. Marketplace First (Not Direct Sales)
**Traditional SaaS:** Build sales team, do enterprise deals
**Rekindle:** Leverage existing marketplaces (Salesforce, HubSpot)

**How:**
- Salesforce AppExchange: 150K customers, 1-click install
- HubSpot Marketplace: 200K customers, 1-click install
- Optimize for marketplace SEO (#1 ranking)
- 5-star reviews from first 50 customers

**Result:** CAC drops from $1,500 → $50 (30x reduction)

---

## 5. Performance Pricing = Zero Friction
**Traditional SaaS:** Upfront payment = high friction
**Rekindle:** Performance-based = zero risk

**How:**
- Free trial (unlimited, no credit card)
- Upgrade when value proven (5+ meetings booked)
- Performance fees only (2.5% of ACV)
- Money-back guarantee (if no ROI in 60 days)

**Result:** Trial-to-paid conversion 20% (vs industry 2-5%)

---

## 6. Customer Success = Product Feature
**Traditional SaaS:** Customer success team (expensive)
**Rekindle:** AI-powered customer success (automated)

**How:**
- ROI dashboard (customers see value in real-time)
- Automated onboarding (AI sets up first campaign)
- Proactive alerts ("Campaign not performing? Try this...")
- Weekly ROI reports (automated emails)

**Result:** Customer success cost = $0 (vs $50K/year per CSM)

---

## 7. Content as Code (Automated)
**Traditional SaaS:** Manual content creation (slow)
**Rekindle:** AI-generated content (fast)

**How:**
- AI writes blog posts from customer data
- AI generates case studies from ROI dashboards
- AI creates social media posts from testimonials
- AI optimizes SEO based on rankings

**Result:** Publish 10 pieces of content per day (vs 1 per week)

---

## 8. Data Flywheel = Compounding Advantage
**Traditional SaaS:** Every customer = separate instance
**Rekindle:** Every customer improves AI for all

**How:**
- Aggregate learnings from all campaigns (privacy-safe)
- Best-performing messages shared across customers
- Trigger detection improves with more data
- Lead scoring improves with more conversions

**Result:** Performance improves 10% per 100 customers (network effect moat)
